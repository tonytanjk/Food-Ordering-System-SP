The project idea is to create a food ordering website for students and food stalls in my school.

Authentication and user log in:
The students must sign up to the website with their admission number and password, if not done so, students can sign up.
If students forget their password, an email can be sent to their email to reset their password.

Admin log-in:
Stall owners can log in here using a unique id and password that enables them to see the Students Id and payment if they order and pay their stall's food.

Students can order their food from whichever stall they want, base on that stall, they can select the food there. Upon entering their order, the food stall owners can use the website to see the order as well on a "Admin page" for stall owners. At the same time, students must pay online base on the price of the food they order. The stall owners will receive the amount that the students pay.
